This project will be a version of a very simple sketch pad, or Etch-a-Sketch, that is one of the assignments from The Odin Project. 

This project is designed to showcase my ability to manipulate the DOM, as well as implement and create elements using javascript, and using listeners for the mouse drag event to change the color of div boxes and leave a trail behind, just like a sketch pad.
